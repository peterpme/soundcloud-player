# Soundcloud Player

## About

This coding challenge for Trunk Club Engineering will utilize my abilities as a Front End Developer. The challenge is to create a minimally interfaced soundcloud player. 

## Tooling

I will be utilizing the following:

- Soundcloud API
- AngularJS


## Thoughts & Setup

The application will only ask for a category of music. The music will then be controlled with a PLAY button. The only other two buttons will be back/next. Since this is a minimal theme. Stay tuned for more details.
