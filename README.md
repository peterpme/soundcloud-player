# Soundcloud Player

## About

This coding challenge for Trunk Club Engineering will utilize my abilities as a UI Engineer. The challenge is to create a minimally interfaced soundcloud player. 

## Tooling

I will be utilizing the following:

- [Soundcloud API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api)
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
- [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Heroku](http://heroku.com)


## Thoughts & Setup

- The application will ask for a certain category of music. Whether this is a dropdown or search feature I haven't decided yet. For the sake of the 4 hour time slot, I might go with a dropdown to focus more on the core development.

- Music will be controlled by a large centrally located play button. Very minimal theme. The potential to add control {back, foward} buttons may be a possibility as well

I do not have much experience with Coffeescript, but I understand Trunk Club utilizes it for all of their projects, so I will challenge myself by writing this in Coffeescript as well.

Timed Challenge of `4 hours`
